                <p>If you know your <span>Greek mythology</span>,<br>you might remember <span>Persephone</span>—the beautiful goddess of spring and harvest, and the queen of the underworld.<br><br>According to legend, her story is the reason for the <span>shift in seasons</span>.</p>

                    <p>Persephone’s story left such a huge impact on restaurateur <span>Jessie Roasa</span> that she decided to name her newest food venture after the goddess.<br><br>After all, the restaurant can be best described as a <span>seasonal kitchen</span>.<br><br>Simply put, this means that diners can expect the menu to shift like seasons every now and then.</p>

				<p>A seasonal kitchen might sound new to a Filipino crowd, especially because we only have two seasons.<br><br>But what I want to allude to is that Filipino taste changes so fast. The seasonality aspect does not only refer to the harvest or the products, but it’s also dependent on the trend and what’s in the market right now.<br><br>It’s very dependent on where everything gravitates towards, and I want to be able to glide with that.<br><br>It gives me enough flexibility but also enough of a framework to be able to work with how everything’s changing.<br><br><span>- Jessie Roasa</span></p>

                <p>Upon entering <span>Persephone - A Seasonal Kitchen</span>, your first instinct would probably lead you to take a photo of the colorful floral mural, an embodiment of Persephone as the <span>deity of spring time</span>.<br><br>This splashy wall is a precursor to what people can expect in their dining experience—one that is characterized by very <span>vibrant and lively</span> dishes and drinks.</p>

She has done restaurant marketing, food styling, and food photography.<br><br>But her first love is <span>cooking</span>. Even as a little girl, she was always into cooking.</p>
